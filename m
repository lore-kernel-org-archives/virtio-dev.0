For the host notifiers support in vhost-user, it's
everything here!

The support in libvhost-user and vhost-user-bridge
is being done in another patchset. And we are also
working on the vIOMMU support. If we really see any
new issues in the future, I'll fix them in small
patches actively.

Thank you very much!
