Live migration is initiated and controlled by the Host,  So the Source Host will
reset the MAC during live migration after unplugging the VF. This is to redirect the
VMs frames towards PF so that they can be received via virtio-net standby interface.
The destination host will set the VF MAC and plug the VF after live migration is
completed.

Allowing the guest to change the MAC will require the qemu/libvirt/mgmt layers to
track the MAC changes and replay that change after live migration.
