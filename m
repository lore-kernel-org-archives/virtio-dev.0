Yes, I have 2 ways of implementation in mind. Basically, I think we will le=
verage the slave side EPT to provide the accessible master memory to the sl=
ave guest. Before getting into that, please let me introduce some backgroun=
d first: here, VM1 is the slave VM, and VM2 is the master VM

The VM2's memory, which is exposed to the vhost-pci driver, does not have t=
o be mapped and added to the bar MemoryRegion when the device is plugged to=
 VM1. They can be added later even after the driver does ioremap of the bar=
.  Here is what this patch series has done:

i. when VM1 boots, the bar MemoryRegion is initialized, and registered via =
pci_register_bar (in the vpnet_pci_realize function), the bar MemoryRegion =
is like a "skeleton" without any real memory added to it, except the 4KB me=
tadata memory which is added to the top of bar MemoryRegion (in vpnet_devic=
e_realize)

ii. when the vhost-pci driver probes, it does ioremap(bar, 64GB), which set=
s up the guest kernel mapping of the 64GB bar, but till now only the top 4K=
B memory has qva->gpa mapping,  which will be referenced to create the EPT =
mapping when accessed.

iii. when VM2 boots, the vhost-user master sends the VM2's memory info to V=
M1, then those memory are mapped by QEMU1 and updated to the vhost-pci bar =
MemoryRegion(in the vp_slave_set_mem_table function). After this, VM2's mem=
ory can appear in VM1's EPT when accessed.



With the above understanding, here are the 2 possible options (which are si=
milar actually) of IOMMU support:
Option1:=20
1) In the above phase iii., when QEMU1 receives the memory info, it does no=
t map and expose the entire memory to the guest, instead, it just stores th=
e memory info there, e.g., info1 (fd1, base1, len1), info2 (fd2, base2, len=
2), info3(fd3, base3, len3) etc.
=20
2) When VM2's virtio-net driver wants to set up dma remapping table entries=
, the dma_map_page function will trap to QEMU2 with iova and gpa (is this c=
orrect? I'll double checked this part)

3) then QEMU2 sends an IOTLB_MSG(iova1, gpa1, size1) to QEMU1 -  iova and u=
addr seem not useful for vhost-pci, so maybe we will need to use gpa instea=
d of uaddr

4) When QEMU1 receives the msg, it compares gpa1 with the memory info, for =
example, it may find base1 < gpa1 < base1+len1, and offset1=3Dgpa1-base1, t=
hen do mmap(.., size1, fd1, offset1), and add the sub MemoryRegion (gpa1, s=
ize1) to the bar memory region, which will finally get the memory added to =
ept.

Option 2:
Similar to Option1, but in 1), QEMU1 can map and exposes the entire memory =
to the guest as non-accessible (instead of not mapping), and changes that p=
ieces of memory (from IOTLB_MSG) to accessible in 4)


Best,
Wei
