I'm worried about leaking PAs.
fundamentally if you want proper protection you
need your device driver to use VA for addressing,

On the one hand BAR only needs to be as large as guest PA then.
On the other hand it must cover all of guest PA,
not just what is accessible to the device.

That library is designed to work with a unix domain socket
though. We'll need extra kernel code to make a device
pretend it's a socket.
