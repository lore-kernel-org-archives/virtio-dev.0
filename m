And the device can read the ring state to see whether it has reset,
perhaps.

Okay.

Indeed. But that would require a different request, then? It also
depends on the use case. A full device reset is a big hammer,
but if used only to get out of rare edge cases, it is good enough.

When the device can just iterate over the outstanding packet, yeah,
that's actually simpler.

Your point about changing frags[] underneath a cloned skb really does
make that hard. We might be able to mitigate individual specific cases
of high latency, such as TC queue occupancy.
