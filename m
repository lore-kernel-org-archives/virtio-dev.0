Basically it comes down to what driver is loaded on it. For now
vfio-pci and virtio would be the only two using the "unmanaged"
version of things.

Really you don't know which autoprobe is in effect until SR-IOV is
enabled by whatever driver. As such you should really be setting both
the drivers_autoprobe and the unmanaged_autoprobe based on the
expected use case.
