That is kind of what I was thinking, and why I was thinking it might
make sense to make the virtio specific changes a separate patch set. I
could get the PCI bits taken care of in the meantime since they effect
genetic PCI, NVMe, and the Amazon ENA interfaces.

Agreed. I believe I brought this up when I was originally asked to
look into the coding for this.

Agreed, though in this case I am not sure it makes sense since this
isn't necessarily something that is a Virtio feature itself. It is
just a side effect of the fact that they are adding SR-IOV support to
a device that happens to emulate Virtio NET and apparently their PF
has to be identical to the VF other than the PCIe extended config
space.

I think I will leave this for Dan and Mark to handle since I am still
not all that familiar with the hardware in use here. Once a decision
has been made him and Mark could look at pushing either the one line
patch or something more complex involving a feature flag.

Thanks.
