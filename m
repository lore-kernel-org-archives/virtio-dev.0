Well NIC VFs are what I know.

As far as the DoS potential I agree that is pretty high. That is one
of the reasons why I am thinking about backing away from doing this as
a global thing and switching back to a per driver solution for this. I
think with the "sriov_configure_unmanaged" function and the new sysfs
attributed for for unmanaged_probe I have half the problem solved. The
issue becomes how to appropriately handle those so that I don't have a
huge mess of bugs or security issues being introduced.

The issue in all this ends up being how to handle the synchronization
between userspace and the kernel. That was the only reason why I was
thinking of that.

An alternative thought I had was to look at just making it so that we
did a minimal vfio version of sriov_configure that only allowed
changing the number of VFs when the device was not already in use,
specifically if the vdev->refcnt was non-zero. So the usage in such a
case would be to bind the driver, set the number of VFs, and then
start the application. On driver unload we would then call
pci_disable_sriov and just clean everything up on the way out.

That seems like a really messy way of doing things though since there
isn't really any way to report exceptions other than just refusing to
set the bit and for all we know that could be the result of a hardware
error.

I'm not saying the PF is unprivileged, it just doesn't have all that
much privilege in these cases. I think you have sighted most of the
big "privileges" that should impact things, specifically the function
resets and the SR-IOV capability.
But as far as actually doing anything like handling global resources
there is a firmware engine that is usually handling things like link,
queues, interrupts, and such. Anyway that is the firmware case which
is only half the problem.

The other side of this is the userspace/SDN guys who are essentially
trying to turn the VMs into network infrastructure and that is where
requests like the userspace PF comes from so that they can get
something like DPDK running on it so that it can act as some piece of
NFV infrastructure such as a firewall or accelerated OVS switch.
Usually the case is if the PF goes down the VFs are going down one way
or another since you aren't getting traffic through either a disabled
firewall or switch.
