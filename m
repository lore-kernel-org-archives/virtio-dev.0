Yes. We are leveraging virtio's feature negotiation mechanism for that. 
Guest which does not acknowledge the support will not have PT plugged in.

No. QEMU will only expose PT device after guest acknowledges the support 
through virtio's feature negotiation.

Only PV device will be exposed on legacy guest.

No, guest doesn't need to be initiating datapath switch at all. However, 
QMP events may be generated when exposing or hiding the PT device 
through hot plug/unplug to facilitate host to switch datapath.

Well, it depends on the use case, and how feasible it can be extended to 
other transport due to constraints and transport specifics.

Although the concept of failover group is generic, the implementation 
itself may vary.
