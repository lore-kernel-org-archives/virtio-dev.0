Either SRIOV device assignment or vDPA helps to build datapath pass-thru context which represented by a virtual interface on management perspective. For entire "vswitch", there still co-exist none pass-thru interface(SW backend) which uses vhost-user for virtual interface.

Thanks, I kind of get the picture here.

A question is about the software backend, e.g what's the software 
counterpart for SRIOV or vDPA? E.g is there a VF or vDPA pmd connected 
to OVS-dpdk and it can switch to offload if required?

For this patch, you need decouple pci specific stuffs out of vhost-user 
which is transport independent (at least now).

> Basic vDPA works even without any qemu change. As vhost-user is well-recognized as the vhost interface for userland backend, it's reasonable to well-support the usage of userland backend w/ I/O accelerator.

Right, so you can do all offloads in qemu, vhost-user could be still 
there. And qemu can switch between the two like a transparent bond or team?

I agree.

This is questionable. From both performance and security points. We had 
example of performance (vIOMMU). For security, e.g in this patch, qemu 
can setup memory region based on the request from vhost-user slave, does 
this increase the attack surface?

I think you missed my point some how, as replied in previous thread, I 
did't object what you propose here. I just want to understand the reason 
you choose vhost-user. And in the cover letter, vswitch case is not 
mentioned at all, instead and it compares vDPA with VFIO. This makes 
reader easily to think that qemu will monopoly the device, so it's 
rather nature to ask why not do it inside qemu.

For some virtual interface, it now tries to bypass the traffic. It's looking forward a consistent vhost-user interface there.

So the point is probably you can keep vhost-user for sw path while 
implementing offloaded path in qemu completely?

Yes, that's why I want a vhost dataplane inside qemu. (btw vhost-user 
should be even worse consider syscall is less expensive than IPC).

Any pointer to this patch?

Well, you can still use vhost (but not vhost-user).

We can keep vhost-user datapath.

By keeping vhost-user datapath there's no such worries. Btw, we will 
probably need a channel between qemu and ovs directly which can 
negotiate more offloads.
