I have incorporated all the changes suggested by you. They are:

  * Changed the failover group identifier from UUID to a 64-bit value.
  * Changed the command line option from "uuid" to * "failover-group-id".
  * Tweaked the "pci-bridge" device's Device ID to
  * PCI_DEVICE_ID_REDHAT_BRIDGE_FAILOVER.
  * Added to new device "pcie-downstream" with Device ID
    PCI_DEVICE_ID_REDHAT_DOWNPORT_FAILOVER (to support the PCIe case).
  * Changed the patch for virtio specification to reflect the above
    changes.

Shall I post v3 for review?

Thanks,
