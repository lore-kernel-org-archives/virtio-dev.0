My plan is to update the Intel IOMMU driver first since it seems like
something that shouldn't require too much expertise in the operation
of the IOMMU to accomplish. My idea was more along the lines of
something like a "iommu=3Dread-only-pt" or maybe "iommu=3Dpt-ro" where the
Tx data would be identity mapped, and the descriptor rings and Rx data
could be in the dynamic mapping setup. The idea is loosely based on
the existing "iommu=3Dpt" option that is normally used on the host if
you want to avoid the cost for dynamic mapping. Basically we just need
to keep an eye on the number of mappings that the device can write to.
Ideally if we leave the Tx as identity mapped that means we never have
to actually write to update any mapping which would mean no having to
jump into the hypervisor to deal with the update. The fact that most
of the drivers already leave the Rx buffers and descriptor rings
statically mapped should essentially take care of the rest for us.
What this would become is a version of "iommu=3Dpt" where the user cares
about preventing the device from possibly corrupting memory, but would
still like better performance at the cost of the device being able to
ready and/all memory on the system.

As far as if it is strict or not I don't know how much we would need
to worry about that for the migration case. Essentially a deferred
IOTLB flush would result in us having extra pages marked as dirty and
non-migratable, but we would need to see how much overhead there is in
the migration to deal with those extra pages versus the cost of having
to do an IOTLB flush on every unmap call.

Anyway this is an idea that just occurred to me the other day so I
still need to do some more research into how easy/difficult
implementing a solution like this would be.

Thanks.
