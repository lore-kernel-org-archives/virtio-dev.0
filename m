vhost-pci setup is incomplete in this patch series.  Currently the guest
slave is unable to participate in feature negotiation or limit the
number of queues.  Reconnection is also not supported yet.

Guest slaves must be able to use a vhost-pci device without requiring
QEMU -device options (like max queues, feature bits, etc) for that
specific slave implementation.  Why?  In a cloud environment it is
incovenient or impossible for users to add QEMU -device options for the
slave implementation they are using.

Addressing these issues will require more vhost-pci<->guest slave
communication.  The number of messages that can be hidden will shrink.
