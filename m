OK. How about just adding comments above to have users noted that this 
function should be used during migration?

If we want to do a sanity check here, I think it would be easier to just 
check !block->bmap here.

Probably not the case, because of the corner case that the memory would 
be hot unplugged after the free page is reported to QEMU.

Yes. Thanks for the reminder. I will add some explanation to the patch 2 
commit log.


Best,
