I wonder if we couldn't look at coming up with an altered security
model for the IOMMU drivers to address some of the performance issues
seen with typical hardware IOMMU?

In the case of most network devices, we seem to be moving toward a
model where the Rx pages are mapped for an extended period of time and
see a fairly high rate of reuse. As such pages mapped as being
writable or read/write by the device are left mapped for an extended
period of time while Tx pages, which are read only, are often
mapped/unmapped since they are coming from some other location in the
kernel beyond the driver's control.

If we were to somehow come up with a model where the read-only(Tx)
pages had access to a pre-allocated memory mapped address, and the
read/write(descriptor rings), write-only(Rx) pages were provided with
dynamic addresses we might be able to come up with a solution that
would allow for fairly high network performance while at least
protecting from memory corruption. The only issue it would open up is
that the device would have the ability to read any/all memory on the
guest. I was wondering about doing something like this with the vIOMMU
with VFIO for the Intel NICs this way since an interface like igb,
ixgbe, ixgbevf, i40e, or i40evf would probably show pretty good
performance under such a model and as long as the writable pages were
being tracked by the vIOMMU. It could even allow for live migration
support if the vIOMMU provided the info needed for migratable/dirty
page tracking and we held off on migrating any of the dynamically
mapped pages until after they were either unmapped or an FLR reset the
device.

Thanks.
