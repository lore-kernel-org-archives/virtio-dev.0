Yes, I think that's right the issue we are discussing here (also 
discussed in the deadlock patch before): Suppose we use a sleep-able 
flag GFP_KERNEL, which gets the caller (fill_balloon or leak_balloon) 
into sleep with balloon_lock being held, and the memory reclaiming from 
GFP_KERNEL would fall into the OOM code path which first invokes the 
oom_notify-->leak_balloon to release some balloon memory, which needs to 
take the balloon_lock that is being held by the task who is sleeping.

So, using GFP_NOWAIT avoids sleeping to get memory through directly 
memory reclaiming, which could fall into that OOM code path that needs 
to take the balloon_lock.

I think the reason we need xb_preload is because radix tree insertion 
needs the memory being preallocated already (it couldn't suffer from 
memory failure during the process of inserting, probably because 
handling the failure there isn't easy, Matthew may know the backstory of 
this)

So, I think we can handle the memory failure with xb_preload, which 
stops going into the radix tree APIs, but shouldn't call radix tree APIs 
without the related memory preallocated.

Best,
Wei
