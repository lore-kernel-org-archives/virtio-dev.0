I think that won't be an issue either for zero page optimization or this 
free page optimization.

For the zero page optimization, QEMU always sends compressed 0s to the 
destination. The zero page is detected at the time QEMU checks it 
(before sending the page). if it is a 0 page, QEMU compresses all 0s 
(actually just a flag) and send it.

For the free page optimization, we skip free pages (could be thought of 
as 0 pages in this context). The zero pages are detected at the time 
guest reports it QEMU. The page won't be reported if it is non-zero 
(i.e. used).


Best,
Wei
