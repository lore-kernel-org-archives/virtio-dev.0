Sorry, but I really do not see how this is not pci-specific.

- One of your components is a bridge. A transport does not necessarily
  have that concept, at least not in a way meaningful for this approach
  to work.
- Even if we can introduce transport-specific ways for other
  transports, the bridge concept still means that the pairing cannot be
  cross-transport.

I think we should be clear what we want from a generic
(transport-agnostic) virtio feature first. Probably some way to relay
an identifier of the to-be-paired device (transport-specific +
information what the transport is?)

zPCI is a strange beast, so first a pointer to a writeup I did:
https://virtualpenguins.blogspot.de/2018/02/notes-on-pci-on-s390x.html

It does support hotplug, within the s390 architectural context, but
that should be fine for our needs here.

My concern comes from the 'no topology' issue. We build a fake topology
in QEMU (to use the generic pci infrastructure), but the guest does not
see any of this. It issues an instruction and gets a list of functions.
This means any bridge information is not accessible to the guest.

Migration with vfio is the case most likely to be relevant. I'm mostly
concerned with not needlessly closing doors, though.

If we can move MAC addresses or VLAN filters on Linux/QEMU/libvirt in
general, there's no inherent reason why we shouldn't be able to do so
on s390 as well. What matters more is probably which pci network cards
are supported (currently Mellanox AFAIK, not sure if there are others).
