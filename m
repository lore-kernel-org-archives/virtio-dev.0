This description is a bit confusing (and you renamed rq_handle as well.)
Does

"The content of the indirection table and unclassified_queue were
originally described based on mathematical operations. In order to make
it easier to understand and to avoid intermixing the array index with
the virtqueue number, introduce a structure rss_rq_id (RSS receive queue
ID) and use it to describe the unclassified_queue and indirection_table
fields."

capture the intent correctly?

"an array of receive virtqueues identified via their rss_rq_id" ?

"only with rss_rq_id references to enabled receive virtqueues" ?

Ok, you remove the line here anyway, so please just ignore my suggestion
for the previous patch.
