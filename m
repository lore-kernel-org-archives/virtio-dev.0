Subject: [virtio-dev] [pci PATCH v3 2/3] vfio: Add support for unmanaged or userspace

From: Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@intel.com>

This patch is meant to allow assignment of an SR-IOV enabled PF, as in VFs
have been generated, with vfio-pci. My understanding is the primary use
case for this is something like DPDK running the PF while the VFs are all
assigned to guests.

A secondary effect of this is that it provides an interface through which
it would be possible to enable SR-IOV on drivers that may not have a
physical function that actually manages the device.

Enabling SR-IOV should be pretty straight forward. As long as there are no
userspace processes currently controlling the interface the number of VFs
can be changed, and VFs will be generated without drivers being loaded on
the host. Once the userspace process begins controlling the interface the
number of VFs cannot be updated via the sysfs until the control is
released.

Note the VFs will have drivers load on them in the host if the
sriov_unmanaged_autoprobe is updated to a value of 1. However the behavior
of the VFs in such a setup cannot be guaranteed as the PF will not be
available until the userspace process starts and begins to manage the
device.

For now I am leaving the value as locked when the PF is being controlled
from userspace as a form of synchronization. Basically this way we cannot
have the number of VFs change out from under the process so it should not
require any notification framework, and the configuration can just be read
out via configuration space accesses.
