You can't migrate between systems with different sets of device features
right now.

As a first step, if you want to migrate to a HW offloaded solution
then you need to enable the feature. It does mean it will go
a bit slower when run with software, so it's only good if
most systems in your cluster do have the HW offload.
I think we can start by getting that working and
think about ways to improve down the road.


That's the usecase we designed FEATURES_OK for though, so I do
think/hope it's enough and we don't need to play with revisions.
