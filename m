What this appears to be is just lack of coordination between
host and guest.

But meanwhile you are spending cycles walking the list uselessly.
Instead of trying nilly-willy, the standard thing to do
is to wait for host to consume an entry and proceed.

Coding it up might be tricky, so it's probably acceptable as is
for now, but please replace the justification about with
a TODO entry that we should synchronize with the host.

functions returning int should return 0 or -errno on failure,
positive return code should indicate progress.

If you want a boolean, use bool pls.

What about the other direction? Can this observe a stale value and
exit erroneously?
