It has its meaning, which is useful for the device setup, but that's not 
useful for the guest. I think the point is most of the mgs are not 
useful for the guest.

IMHO, the relay mechanism is useful when

1) the QEMU slave handler doesn't need to process the messages at all 
(receive and directly pass on to the guest)

2) most of the msgs are useful for the guest (say we have more than 20 
msgs, only 2 or 3 of them are useful for the guest, why let the device 
pass all of them to the guest)

Also the relay mechanism complicates the vhost-user protocol 
interaction: normally, only master<->QemuSlave. With the relay 
mechanism, it will be master<->QemuSlave<->GuestSlave. For example, when 
the master sends VHOST_USER_GET_QUEUE_NUM, normally it can be answered 
by QemuSlave directly. Why complicate it by passing the msg the 
GuestSlave, and then get the same answer from GuestSlave.

Actually vhost-user isn't state-machine based.

This is the same as virtio - we don't have a single virtio device, we 
have virtio-net, virtio-blk etc.

So, the same way, we can have a common TYPE_VHOST_PCI_DEVICE parent 
device (like TYPE_VIRTIO_DEVICE), but net may have its own special 
features like MRG_RXBUF, and own config registers like mac[6] etc, so we 
can have TYPE_VHOST_PCI_NET under TYPE_VHOST_PCI_DEVICE.

The virtio spec doesn't seem to require the device to have at lease one 
virtqueue. It doesn't make a huge difference to me whether it is a 
virtio device or a regular PCI device. We use it as a virtio device 
because it acts as a backend of virtio devices, not sure if it could be 
used by other devices (I guess virtio would be the main 
paravirtualized-like device here)
