Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Cornelia. With questions below, I
think you raised really good points, some of which I don't have answer
yet and would also like to explore here.

First off, I don't want to push the discussion to the extreme at this
point, or sell anything about having QEMU manage everything
automatically. Don't get me wrong, it's not there yet. Let's don't
assume we are tied to a specific or concerte solution. I think the key
for our discussion might be to define or refine the boundary between
VM and guest,  e.g. what each layer is expected to control and manage
exactly.

In my view, there might be possibly 3 different options to represent
the failover device conceipt to QEMU and libvirt (or any upper layer
software):

a. Seperate device: in this model, virtio and passthough remains
separate devices just as today. QEMU exposes the standby feature bit
for virtio, and publish status/event around the negotiation process of
this feature bit for libvirt to react upon. Since Libvirt has the
pairing relationship itself, maybe through MAC address or something
else, it can control the presence of primary by hot plugging or
unplugging the passthrough device, although it has to work tightly
with virtio's feature negotation process. Not just for migration but
also various corner scenarios (driver/feature ok, device reset,
reboot, legacy guest etc) along virtio's feature negotiation.

b. Coupled device: in this model, virtio and passthough devices are
weakly coupled using some group ID, i.e. QEMU match the passthough
device for a standby virtio instance by comparing the group ID value
present behind each device's bridge. Libvirt provides QEMU the group
ID for both type of devices, and only deals with hot plug for
migration, by checking some migration status exposed (e.g. the feature
negotiation status on the virtio device) by QEMU. QEMU manages the
visibility of the primary in guest along virtio's feature negotiation
process.

c. Fully combined device: in this model, virtio and passthough devices
are viewed as a single VM interface altogther. QEMU not just controls
the visibility of the primary in guest, but can also manage the
exposure of the passthrough for migratability. It can be like that
libvirt supplies the group ID to QEMU. Or libvirt does not even have
to provide group ID for grouping the two devices, if just one single
combined device is exposed by QEMU. In either case, QEMU manages all
aspect of such internal construct, including virtio feature
negotiation, presence of the primary, and live migration.

It looks like to me that, in your opinion, you seem to prefer go with
(a). While I'm actually okay with either (b) or (c). Do I understand
your point correctly?

The reason that I feel that (a) might not be ideal, just as Michael
alluded to (quoting below), is that as management stack, it really
doesn't need to care about the detailed process of feature negotiation
(if we view the guest presence of the primary as part of feature
negotiation at an extended level not just virtio). All it needs to be
done is to hand in the required devices to QEMU and that's all. Why do
we need to addd various hooks, events for whichever happens internally
within the guest?

''
Primary device is added with a special "primary-failover" flag.
A virtual machine is then initialized with just a standby virtio
device. Primary is not yet added.

Later QEMU detects that guest driver device set DRIVER_OK.
It then exposes the primary device to the guest, and triggers
a device addition event (hot-plug event) for it.

If QEMU detects guest driver removal, it initiates a hot-unplug sequence
to remove the primary driver.  In particular, if QEMU detects guest
re-initialization (e.g. by detecting guest reset) it immediately removes
the primary device.
''

and,

''
management just wants to give the primary to guest and later take it back,
it really does not care about the details of the process,
so I don't see what does pushing it up the stack buy you.

So I don't think it *needs* to be done in libvirt. It probably can if you
add a bunch of hooks so it knows whenever vm reboots, driver binds and
unbinds from device, and can check that backup flag was set.
If you are pushing for a setup like that please get a buy-in
from libvirt maintainers or better write a patch.
''

Let me know if my clarifications sound clear to you now.


Thanks,
