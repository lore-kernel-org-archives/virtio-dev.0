But the portable solutions are ACPI and DT.

Describing the DMA dependency through a device would require the guest
to probe the device before all others. How do we communicate this?
* pass a kernel parameter saying something like "probe_first=00:01.0"
* make sure that the PCI root complex is probed before any other
platform device (since the IOMMU can manage DMA of platform devices).
* change DT, ACPI and PCI core code to handle this probe_first kernel
parameter.

Better go with something standard, that any OS and hypervisor knows how
to use, and that other IOMMU devices already use.

Eventually yes. I'll give it a try next year, once the dma-iommu changes
are on the list. It's not a priority for me, given that x86 already has
a pvIOMMU with VT-d, and that Arm still needs one. It shouldn't block
this series.

I'll wait to see if Joerg has other concerns about the design or the
code, and resend in January. I think that IOMMU driver changes should go
through his tree.

Thanks,
Jean
