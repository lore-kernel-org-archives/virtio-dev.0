AFAIU you answered your own questions (questions above, answers below). Gonglei
has just stated that he intends to abandon the queue_id.

AFAIU that's what we have agreed, basically. I'm not sure about your wording
(for instance I would have said session identifier instead of session information),
but I think we think the same. In short conceptually all configured data queues
are equivalent in the sense that it does not matter on which queue a request is
placed -- modulo capacity.
