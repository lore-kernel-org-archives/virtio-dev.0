I've been pointed to this discussion (which I had missed previously)
and I'm getting a headache. Let me first summarize how I understand how
this feature is supposed to work, then I'll respond to some individual
points.

The basic idea is to enable guests to migrate seamlessly, while still
making it possible for them to use a passed-through device for more
performance etc. The means to do so is to hook a virtio-net device
together with a network device passed through via vfio. The
vfio-handled device is there for performance, the virtio device for
migratability. We have a new virtio feature bit for that which needs to
be negotiated for that 'combined' device to be available. We have to
consider two cases:

- Older guests that do not support the new feature bit. We presume that
  those guests will be confused if they get two network devices with
  the same MAC, so the idea is to not show them the vfio-handled device
  at all.
- Guests that negotiate the feature bit. We only know positively that
  they (a) know the feature bit and (b) are prepared to handle the
  consequences of negotiating it after they set the FEATURES_OK bit.
  This is therefore the earliest point in time that the vfio-handled
  device should be visible or usable for the guest.

So, do you know from the outset that there will be such a coupled
device? I.e., is it a property of the VM definition?

Can there be a 'prepared' virtio-net device that presents the STANDBY
feature even if there currently is no vfio-handled device available --
but making it possible to simply hotplug that device later?

Should it be possible to add a virtio/vfio pair later on?

I think we need to be really careful to not mix up the two: The VM
contains the definitions, but it is up to the guest how it uses them.

I do not really see how you can manage that kind of stuff in QEMU only.
Have you talked to some libvirt folks? (And I'm not sure what you refer
to with 'group UUID'?)

Also, I think you need to make a distinction between hotplugging a
device and making it visible to the guest. What does 'hotplugging' mean
here? Adding it to the VM definition? Would it be enough to have the
vfio-based device not operational until the virtio feature bit has been
negotiated?

What happens if the guest does not use the vfio-based device after it
has been made available? Will you still disable the virtio-net link?
(All that link handling definitely sounds like a task for libvirt or
the like.)

Regarding hot(un)plugging during migration, I think you also need to
keep in mind that different architectures/busses have different
semantics there. Something that works if there's an unplug handshake may
not work on a platform with surprise removal.

Have you considered guest agents? All of this is punching through
several layers, and I'm not sure if that is a good idea.
