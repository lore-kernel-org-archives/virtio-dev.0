I'd be good with this being referred to as "lightweight SRIOV enablement".

The only reason why I was referring to it as "unmanaged" was because I
am used to drivers that use the PF MMIO registers to manage VF
resources and that doesn't exist in this model. Obviously this is all
still managed via the extended PCIe configuration though so there is
still some management taking place by the PCI subsystem in the kernel.

Thanks.
