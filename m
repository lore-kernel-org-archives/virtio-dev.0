The comment still stands for the probe request, viommu_get_req_size will
return @bottom depending on viommu->probe_size.

1s isn't a good timeout value, but I don't know what's good. In a
prototype I have, even 1s isn't enough. The attach request (for nested
mode) requires my device to pin down the whole guest memory, and the guest
ends up timing out on the fastmodel because the request takes too long and
the model timer runs too fast...

I was tempted to simply remove this timeout, but I still think having a
way out when the host device fails is preferable. Otherwise this
completely locks up the CPU.

I was hoping this could switch to the host quicker than cpu_relax(),
allowing it to handle the request faster (on ARM udelay could do WFE
instead of YIELD). The value is completely arbitrary.

Maybe I can replace this with cpu_relax for now. I'd like to refine this
function anyway when working on performance improvements, but I'm not too
hopeful we'll get something nicer here.

Right

That comment applies to the virtio-iommu domain - the virtio-iommu
device needs to destroy the old domain when attaching to a new domain,
to avoid any mapping leak. I'll change the comment to clarify this.

In the kernel the domain lifetime differs from the virtio-iommu domain,
the detached domain isn't freed until someone calls free_domain()
explicitly:

- Initially each device is attached to the default domain, used for
  kernel DMA.
- Then VFIO attaches the group to a new domain. The IOMMU core calls
  attach_dev(). Default domain is detached and the VFIO domain is
  attached.
- When VFIO removes the device from its container, the IOMMU core
  attaches the default domain again. The default domain may still have
  mappings (SW_MSI for instance) but the device deleted them, so they
  need to be replayed after the attach request.
- VFIO issues iommu_domain_free when no group is attached to the VFIO
  domain anymore.

Yes, I went back to a simple int instead of refcount

Right, adding HEADERS_CHECK to my config :)
