I suppose we could. I would just have to check and see if we have any
drivers lurking out there that are supporting SR-IOV without
supporting the sysfs approach. As long as that is the case we could
probably put it there.

Right. We can argue that another day. I was just sighting the igb behavior.

Well it is but it isn't. The pci_restore_state will call
pci_restore_iov_state which will just repopulate the data straight out
of the pdev->sriov structure. I think the assumption is we were
already carrying enough information that there wasn't any point in
saving the state since we could just restore it from that structure
anyway.

I've been chasing it down and can verify that much this morning after
testing. A regular hit of the sysfs reset control will not erase the
state. One issue that I think I found that may be a bug though is if I
load the vfio-pci driver on an interface and unbind it I am seeing the
port state reset. I have it chased down to the idle D3 code. It looks
like going from vfio_pci_probe to vfio_pci_remove is triggering the
equivilent of the pci_pm_reset since it is cycling me through
D0->D3->D0 without restoring state after the fact. I also verified
that setting disable_idle_d3 resolves the issue. Would you have any
complaints about me doing a save_state in the probe call, and a
restore_state in the remove? It seems like that should probably be the
easiest fix.

To some extent I agree with the shooting yourself in the foot. At the
same time there isn't actually all that much to re-enable SR-IOV.
Restoring the PCI SR-IOV configuration space and re-enabling the bus
master enable.

The Amazon guys would probably know better than I since I haven't
really worked much with one of these parts yet. Actually the virtio
that Mark pushed may behave the same way too. As far as I know in
these firmware cases the hardware itself has everything
pre-partitioned and set to re-enable as soon as the SR-IOV bits are
set. I think all they need is a few bits toggled and they are pretty
much good to go.

In the case of these sort of parts the PF isn't really all that
privileged. Usually the PF is just a VF with the SR-IOV capability
hanging off of it. I suspect the only thing that might outright
control anything would be the bus master enable bit. Everything else
could be independent. The PF driver in such cases doesn't do much. It
is basically just the host for the configuration space.

Right, but at the same time I consider this to be a shoot yourself in
the foot type scenario. If you are going to hand off your PF while VFs
are active then you are asking for whatever repercussions you end up
getting. I've added a warning and a TAINT_USER flag to my code at this
point if you load an active PF in vfio, and I have added a function
that locks the setting so it cannot be changed once we place a PF in
the control of vfio-pci.

The way I see it there are two scenarios. One where the PF is just a
VF with an extra bit of SR-IOV configuration space floating off of it.
The other is where we want to have SR-IOV enabled and have some third
party managing the PF.  The first one doesn't really care about the
communication and would prefer that whatever owns the driver on the PF
just ignore the SR-IOV portion of the configuration space. The second
one actually cares and would want some sort of
communication/cooperation but for now I don't see that as being the
easiest thing to do so it might be best to just let it see a fixed
number of VFs it just has to work with that.

As far as the device randomly resetting I don't really see how that is
any different from what we already have in terms of solutions
including stuff supported by in-driver SR-IOV. The Intel drivers are
notorious for resetting for any little thing like an MTU change. Us
resetting due to someone calling open/release on an interface wouldn't
be anything new. In addition AER can always hit us too. Yes we don't
have the same recovery mechanisms in place, but in the case of
something such as this we probably don't need that complex of a
recovery setup.

I would think there probably is. If not we wouldn't have gotten the
patches earlier that were still doing the tainting and warning and
making use of the vfio-pci driver to enable SR-IOV. I suspect the use
case for all this is to enable SR-IOV, setup the PF in vfio-pci, and
then assign VFs into and out of guests. I don't see the PF doing a lot
of moving after it is setup. The taint flag only really applies if
someone is looking for support and quite honestly I figure for now the
USER flag is appropriate for this kind of thing since we are deferring
all the networking control to the PF which is managed by userspace.

I think the general idea here is that the user has already tested this
out and determined for themselves that the user driver does what they
want/need. If it didn't they wouldn't be going to all these lengths to
set this up.

I am pretty sure that you are describing is true of some, but not for
all. I think the Amazon solutions and the virtio solution are doing
hard partitioning of the part. I will leave it to those guys to speak
for themselves since I don't know anything about the hardware design
of those parts.
