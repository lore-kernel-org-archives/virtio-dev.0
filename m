This scheme has the problem that one device has to depend on the 
presence of the other - QEMU has the implication of the enumeration 
order if the two are not placed in the same birdge or PCI hierarchy. You 
can't get it reliably working if the bridge is going to be realized 
while the dependent PV device hadn't been yet, or vice versa.

The plan is to enable group ID based matching in the first place rather 
than match by MAC, the latter of which is fragile and problematic. I 
have made the Linux side changes and will get it posted once the QEMU 
discussion for grouping is finalized.

These scenarios are different than the case with no driver support at 
all within guest. I think I particularly raised this as part of doing 
proper error handling when reviewing the original virtio failover patch 
- if failover module fails to enslave the VF due to guest network 
configurations, it has to signal virtio-net to propagate the error back 
to host. One way to handle that is to have virtio-net kick out a device 
reset and clear the feature bit upon re-negotiation, such that VF will 
be plugged out and won't get plugged in. I don't know for what reason 
the patch submitter did not incorporate that change. But it's in our 
plan to enhance that part, no worries.

 From migration point of view, it does not matter if guest lacks driver 
support for VF. I like to avoid duplicating hyper-v concept if at all 
possible. What makes sense with Hyper-V's accelerated networking doesn't 
have to work with KVM/QEMU SR-IOV live migration. Are you sure that the 
Hyper-V control message was added for this sole purpose? Seems to me an 
overkill for such an edge scenario.

(loop in Intel folks and Linux netdev)

Actually it's not without reason that Linux/virtio has to diverge from 
Hyper-V. The Hyper-V SR-IOV driver model allows VF be plugged in and 
registered with the stack without a MAC address filter programmed in the 
NIC, while Windows Hyper-V at the host side is able to move a MAC filter 
around from the NIC PV backend to VF upon receiving the DATAPATH_SWITCH 
control message initiated by guest. Windows NDIS has 
OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER API to have PF update the MAC filter for 
the VF without involving guest or VF. For all of these there are no 
equivalent in the Linux SR-IOV driver model. How do you propose to have 
guest initiate the datapath switching at any point in time when you're 
dealing with Linux host network stack?

One may say we can plug in a VF with a random MAC filter programmed in 
prior, and initially use that random MAC within guest. This would require:

a) not relying on permanent MAC address to do pairing during the initial 
discovery, e.g. use the failover group ID as in this discussion
b) host to toggle the MAC address filter: which includes taking down the 
tap device to return the MAC back to PF, followed by assigning that MAC 
to VF using "ip link ... set vf ..."
c) notify guest to reload/reset VF driver for the change of hardware MAC 
address
d) until VF reloads the driver it won't be able to use the datapath, so 
very short period of network outage is (still) expected

But as you see this still diverges from the Hyper-V model. What do we 
buy for using a random address during initial discovery and requiring VF 
to complete the handshake? Less network downtime during datapath 
switching? Sorry but that's not a key factor at all for our main goal - 
live migration.
