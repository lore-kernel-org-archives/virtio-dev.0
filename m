On the other hand, GuestSlave needs an implementation to reply back to the QEMU device, and this implementation isn't needed by QemuSlave.

Yes, it is too difficult to reuse in practice.

I'm not sure if libvhost-user would be limited to be used by QEMU only 
in practice. For example, DPDK currently implements its own vhost-user 
slave, and changing to use libvhost-user may require dpdk to be bound 
with QEMU, that is, applications like OVS-DPDK will have a dependency on 
QEMU. Probably people wouldn't want it this way.

On the other side, vhost-pci is more coupled with the QEMU 
implementation, because some of the msg handling will need to do some 
device setup (e.g. mmap memory and add sub MemoryRegion to the bar). 
This device emulation related code is specific to QEMU, so I think 
vhost-pci slave may not be reused by applications other than QEMU.

Would it be acceptable to use the vhost-pci slave from this patch series 
as the initial solution? It is already implemented, and we can 
investigate the possibility of integrating it into the libvhost-user as 
the next step.

Best,
Wei
