We need to know what the device offers if it offers the feature bit,
and what it is supposed to do when the driver negotiates it. Currently,
we can only go by what the Linux driver does and what it expects. IOW,
we need a spec update proposal. Obviously, this should be discussed in
conjunction with the rest.

Whether matching by MAC is good or sufficient is a different
discussion. It is, however, what the code currently *does*, and in
absence of a spec update, it is the only reference for this feature.

This is scheduled to be released with the next Linux version, which is
right now in the -rc phase. It *is* API (a guest <-> host API).

No corresponding code is present in QEMU 3.0, which is in freeze right
now. Anything that goes into QEMU 3.1 or later needs to accommodate
Linux 4.18 as a guest.

That's exactly my point: We need to care about not-Linux. And about
not-QEMU as well. A virtio feature bit should not be defined by what
Linux and QEMU do, but needs a real spec.

So, currently we have a Linux driver implementation that matches by
MAC. If a Linux version with this is released, every device that offers
VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY needs to support matching by MAC so that this
Linux driver will not break. Adding further matching methods should be
fine, but might need additional features (needs to be discussed).
