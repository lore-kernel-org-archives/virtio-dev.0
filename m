I agree with that. I think it would be clearer to say
that driver must not (or should not?) submit longer requests
than to say that it should read this field.

About not saying what happens if driver does something stupid,
we generally don't.

So you are saying why aren't max_dataqueues and
max_cipher_key_len consistent?
It's a valid point.

to me most questions look like you have a rather specific wording in mind.
How about instead of asking questions you just propose a
specific fixed wording as your own patch?

That will make things converge faster.

That's up to you, wasn't very clear to me but maybe it's clear
enough to Mike.

I disagree here.

Standards evolve too. A requirement to be 100% correct isn't realistic.

Whoever implements the spec will come back to us and say
"hey I did exactly as standard says and it does not work"
and then we'll either fix the standard or say
"too bad, fix the hypervisor" or say "we weren't clear,
hypervisors implemented spec correctly but we meant something else,
let's add a feature bit so future ones will get it right".

We can always add feature bits when we change behaviour in incompatible
ways.
