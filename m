But this patch set defines a host<->guest interface to make pairing
information on the host available to the guest, no?

=46rom my point of view, there are several concerns:
- This approach assumes a homogeneous pairing (same transport), and
  even more, it assumes that this transport is pci.
- It won't work for zPCI (although zPCI is really strange) -- this
  means it will be completely unusable on s390x.
- It is too focused on a narrow use case. How is it supposed to be
  extended?

What I would prefer:
- Implement a pairing id support that does not rely on a certain
  transport, but leverages virtio (which is in the game anyway). We'd
  get at least the "virtio-net device paired with vfio" use case, which
  is what is currently implemented in the Linux kernel.
- Think about a more generic way to relay configuration metadata to the
  host.
