That is pretty much what I have in mind. Basically the vfio ends up
being much more savvy in this regard and so it becomes the obvious
choice for something like a user space PF driver.

Yeah. I believe that is patch 3 in the set is the one that enables
virtio as we have a part that emulates virtio_net for the PF and VFs,
but the PF interface is exposing the necessary SR-IOV PCIe
configuration bits.

I think I understand what you are trying to say here. I'm beginning to
think I may back away from the PF driver use case, and instead just
focus on the virtio one for now.

The privileged user part isn't an issue I think, and there are already
solutions out there doing this via igb_uio.

I'm not arguing that is the case. That is one of the reasons why we
taint the kernel as soon as the SR-IOV VFs are allocated. The fact is
a userspace PF is bound to cause issues one way or another simply
because it adds that much more complexity to the test matrix.

In the case of the virtio device I know the device IDs which is why we
did the stub for that since it is a firmware managed device. Are you
arguing we need to fork VFIO and create a new PF stub driver based on
that to support the SR-IOV use case?

I think part of the issue is the fact that some of these designs are
probably too flexible for their own good. In the example of the part
that needs SR-IOV support on virtio_net the issue is that the PF is
just another partition of the same logic that is supporting the VFs.
As such whatever they decide to expose as a VF appears as a PF. I
would imagine that could be problematic if the number of options gets
to be wide enough.

So if you take a look at my recent v3 patch set patch 2 includes the
patch for virtio_net. Basically all the PF has is a virtio_net
interface with an extended PCIe configuration space that includes the
necessary support for AER and SR-IOV. It is my understanding that
there is no way for the PF MMIO space to configure anything related to
the VFs since nothing like that exists in virtio_net.

I agree. Part of the reason for this patch set is to keep the
discussion on this going since it had kind of died off and after 4+
different attempts at getting something like this I thought I would
try to take it on myself since I have been involved in at least 2 of
the efforts now.

That is what I started doing in v2. Basically for v2/v3 of this patch
set I had limited it down to virtio and vfio-pci. I'm beginning to
thing for v4 I might just drop the vfio-pci bits for now. If the
Amazon guys have some device IDs for their devices I could look at
putting together the suggested pci-stub-pf for them if needed.
Otherwise I will probably just drop this to two patches and they can
do it themselves later.

So what ends up happening is that we have a privileged process that is
necessary for the guests running with assigned VFs to function. The
problem as I understand it is we don't really have anything here to
enforce the policy needed in order to get security. Instead we are
relying on the user to configure things correctly, and we cannot rely
on that. I can see what we can do, but of course part of the issue is
that when a SIGKILL is all that is needed to end the process it makes
coordination of things a pretty big challenge.
