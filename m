Some parts are even not relevant to vhost, they're basic device function enabling. Moreover, it could be different kinds of devices(network/block/...) under vhost. No matter # of vendors or # of types, total LOC is not small.

As vhost protocol is de factor standard, it leverages kernel device driver to provide the diversity. Changing once in QEMU, then it supports multi-vendor devices whose drivers naturally providing kernel driver there.

Dependency on a kernel driver is fine IMHO. It's the dependency on a
DPDK backend that makes people unhappy, since the functionality
in question is setup-time only.

As others said, we do not need to go overeboard. A couple of small
vendor-specific quirks in qemu isn't a big deal.
