Some parts are even not relevant to vhost, they're basic device function enabling. Moreover, it could be different kinds of devices(network/block/...) under vhost. No matter # of vendors or # of types, total LOC is not small.

As vhost protocol is de factor standard, it leverages kernel device driver to provide the diversity. Changing once in QEMU, then it supports multi-vendor devices whose drivers naturally providing kernel driver there.

Let me clarify my question, it's not qemu vs kenrel but userspace vs 
kernel. It could be a library which could be linked to qemu. Doing it in 
userspace have the following obvious advantages:

- attack surface was limited to userspace
- easier to be maintained (compared to kernel driver)
- easier to be extended without introducing new userspace/kernel interfaces
- not tied to a specific operating system

If we want to do it in the kernel, need to consider to unify code 
between mdev device driver and generic driver. For net driver, maybe we 
can even consider to do it on top of exist drivers.

I'm doing this now by implementing vhost inside qemu IOThreads. Hope I 
can post RFC in few months.

Thanks
