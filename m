Precopy already has its own notifiers: git 99a0db9b
If we want to reuse, that one would be more suitable. I think mixing 
non-related events into one notifier list isn't nice.

Thanks for sharing your concerns in detail, which are quite helpful for 
the discussion. To reuse 99a0db9b, we can also add sub-states (or say 
events), instead of new migration states.
For example, we can still define "enum RamSaveState" as above, which can 
be an indication for the notifier queued on the 99a0db9b notider_list to 
decide whether to call start or stop.
Does this solve your concern?

OK, I can implement it with notifiers, but this (framework) is usually 
added when someday there is a second user who needs a callback at the 
same place.

We need to use polling here because of some back story in the guest side 
(due to some locks being held) that makes it a barrier to sending 
notifications for each hints.

Compared to the time spent by the legacy migration to send free pages, 
that small amount of CPU usage spent on filtering free pages could be 
neglected.
Grinding a chopper will not hold up the work of cutting firewood :)
