This is out of RFC, since we have two commands which are useful
to discover supported group types (ATM can be none or SR-IOV).

Change log:

since v7:
	make high level error codes match linux, with virtio specific codes
		in a separate field
	renamed _ACCEPT to _USE since that's what it does
	clarified forward compatibility and non pci transports
	support multiple admin vqs
	conformance statements
	lots of changes all over the place to I changed author from Max
	to myself. Don't need to take credit but also don't want
	to blame Max for my mistakes.

since v6:

	- removed some extentions intended for future use.
	  We'll do them when we get there.

	- brought back command list query from v5 in a simplified form -
	  it's here to address the case where a single parent
	  can address multiple groups, such as PF addressing
	  transport vq and sriov vfs.

	- attempt to make terminology more formal.
	In particular a term for whoever controls the group.
 	I am still going back
	and forth between "parent" and "owner" - owner might
	be better after all since it will work if we ever
	have a self group. For now it's parent.

TODO (maybe?) - probably ok to defer until this part is upstream:

	Add "all members" member id.

	Add commands for MSI, feature discovery.

	Add commands for transport vq.


My intent is to try and support both SR-IOV and SIOV
usecases with the same structure and maybe even the same
VQ.

For example, it might make sense to split creating/destroying
SIOV devices from the transport passing data from the guest - the
driver would then not negotiate VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV (which
then means auto-provisioning).


Michael S. Tsirkin (9):
  virtio: document forward compatibility guarantees
  admin: introduce device group and related concepts
  admin: introduce group administration commands
  admin: introduce virtio admin virtqueues
  pci: add admin vq registers to virtio over pci
  mmio: document ADMIN_VQ as reserved
  ccw: document ADMIN_VQ as reserved
  admin: command list discovery
  admin: conformance clauses
