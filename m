Sure. Notifiers are used when an event happens. In this case, it would 
be a state change, which invokes the state change callback. So I think 
we probably need to add 2 new states for the start and stop callback.

I haven't made documents to explain it yet. It's planed to be ready 
after this code series is done. But I'm glad to answer the questions below.

Yes. Migration is the one that currently benefits a lot from this 
feature. I haven't thought of others so far. It is common that new 
features start with just 1 or 2 typical use cases.

The high-level introduction would be
1. host sends a start cmd id to the guest;
2. the guest starts a new round of reporting by sending a cmd_id+free 
page hints to host;
3. QEMU side optimization code applies the free page hints (filter them 
from the dirty bitmap) only when the reported cmd id matches the one 
that was just sent.

The protocol was suggested by Michael and has been thoroughly discussed 
when upstreaming the kernel part. It might not be necessary to go over 
that again :)
I would suggest to focus on the supplied interface and its usage in live 
migration. That is, now we have two APIs, start() and stop(), to start 
and stop the optimization.

1) where in the migration code should we use them (do you agree with the 
step (1), (2), (3) you concluded below?)
2) how should we use them, directly do global call or via notifiers?

We start to filter out free pages from the dirty bitmap only when all 
the dirty bits are ready there, i.e. after sync bitmap. To some degree, 
the action of synchronizing bitmap indicates the end of the last round 
and the beginning of the new round, so we stop the free page 
optimization for the old round when the old round ends.

Could you please explain more about the race you saw? (free page is 
reported from the guest, and the bitmap is tracked in KVM)

Yes. Step(1) guarantees us that the QEMU side optimization call has 
exited (we don't need to rely on guest side ACK because the guest could 
be in any state). This is enough. If the guest continues to report after 
that, that reported hints will be detected as stale hints and dropped in 
the next start of optimization.

Sure.
For kernel part, you can get it from linux-next: 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
For the v7 QEMU part: 
git://github.com/wei-w-wang/qemu-free-page-hint.git (my connection to 
github is too slow, it would be ready in 24hours, I can also send you 
the raw patches via email if you need)


Best,
Wei
