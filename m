I intend to have a different opinion about this:

1) Even relaying the msgs to the guest, QEMU still need to handle the 
msg first, for example, it needs to decode the msg to see if it is the 
ones (e.g. SET_MEM_TABLE, SET_VRING_KICK, SET_VRING_CALL) that should be 
used for the device setup (e.g. mmap the memory given via 
SET_MEM_TABLE). In this case, we will be likely to have 2 slave handlers 
- one in the guest, another in QEMU device.

2) If people already understand the vhost-user protocol, it would be 
natural for them to understand the vhost-pci metadata - just the 
obtained memory and vring info are put to the metadata area (no new things).


Inspired from your sharing, how about the following:
we can actually factor out a common vhost-pci layer, which handles all 
the features that are common to all the vhost-pci series of devices 
(vhost-pci-net, vhost-pci-blk,...)
Coming to the implementation, we can have a VhostpciDeviceClass (similar 
to VirtioDeviceClass), the device realize sequence will be 
virtio_device_realize()-->vhost_pci_device_realize()-->vhost_pci_net_device_realize()

Yes, that tx is a dummy actually, just created to use its doorbell. 
Currently, with virtio_device, I think ioeventfd comes with virtqueue 
only. Actually, I think we could have the issues solved by vhost-pci. 
For example, reserve a piece of  the BAR area for ioeventfd. The bar 
layout can be:
BAR 2:
0~4k: vhost-pci device specific usages (ioeventfd etc)
4k~8k: metadata (memory info and vring info)
8k~64GB: remote guest memory
(we can make the bar size (64GB is the default value used) configurable 
via qemu cmdline)


Best,
Wei
