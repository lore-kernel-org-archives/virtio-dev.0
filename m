Yes, that would be a bit unfortunate.

You mean via different mechanisms?

Thinking about it, do we need any knob to keep the vfio device
invisible if the virtio device is not present? IOW, how does the
hypervisor know that the vfio device is supposed to be paired with a
virtio device? It seems we need an explicit tie-in.

I don't think so. Dasds have some channel commands that don't map
easily to scsi commands.

I'm not opposed to figuring out this one, but I'm not sure whether we
want to extend it to more device types.

Are people looking into generic migration support? I have it on my
things-to-look-at list (figuring out what needs to be device specific
and what can be generic, figuring out how we can support vfio-ccw,
etc.).
