The definition is incomplete due to lack of spec. There's no "host"
part defined yet in the host-guest interface. If match by MAC is an
interface, the same must be done on the host(device) side as well,
which has been agreed not the way to go. However, I don't think that's
what the author intends to do by interpreting his QEMU patch - it
missed the other parts as well, such as the feature negotiation and
how it interacts with the paired device.

What I said is that match by MAC is just a guest implementation that
one can change at any time. We now have the group ID on QEMU, why
still sticking to matching by MAC? It shoulnd't be a host-guest
interface in the first place anyway.

Not really, it's the same discussion. Before the group ID discussion I
explicitly asked for the spec for VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY about the
semantics.  Since no one come up with a spec, I assumed it is still
being worked on and it was all right to have the initial Linux
implementation to be in. I assume that is a formal process while
working on a complicated feature the spec can come later once
everything becomes clear along with the discussions.

https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg499011.html

I made the same claim at the time that we shouldn't go with what's
been implemented in Linux, but instead should look at the entire
picture to decide what should be the right semantics for
VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY. I agree with you we need a spec. I can work on a
spec but I'd like to clarify that there was nothing defined yet for
VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY so it shouldn't be called as spec update. It's
still a work-in-progress feature that IMHO it's different than the
situation that there used to be pre-spec virtio implementation already
working on both host and guest side. The current VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY
implementation in Linux is pretty much dead code without a spec
followed by a host/device side implementation.
