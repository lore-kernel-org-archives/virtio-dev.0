This is also suggested by Michael, which sounds good to me. Using config 
is doable, but that doesn't show advantages over using feature bits.

All the emulator implementations need to follow the virtio spec. We will 
finally have this feature written to the virtio-balloon device section, 
and state that the F_PAGE_POISON needs to be set on the device when 
F_FREE_PAGE_HINT is set on the device.
