It's actually OK here, I think we don't need the guarantee. The device 
is just the consumer of the vq, essentially it doesn't have a dependency 
(i.e. won't block or cause errors) on the guest state.
For example:
1) when the device executes "while (runstate_is_running())" and finds 
that the guest is running, it proceeds;
2) the guest is stopped immediately right after the "while 
(runstate_is_running())" check;
3) the device side execution reaches virtqueue_pop(), and finds 
"elem==NULL", since the driver (provider) stops adding hints. Then it 
continues by going back to "while (runstate_is_running())", and now it 
finds the guest is stopped, and then exits.

Essentially, this runstate check is just an optimization to the case 
that the driver is stopped to provide hints while the device side 
optimization thread is still polling the empty vq (i.e. effort in vain). 
Probably, it would be better to check the runstate under "elem==NULL":

while (1) {
     ...
     elem = virtqueue_pop(vq, sizeof(VirtQueueElement));
     if (!elem) {
             qemu_spin_unlock(&dev->free_page_lock);
             if (runstate_is_running())
                 continue;
             else
                 break;
     }
     ...
}

No, actually we don't need "else". Please see the code inside if 
(elem->in_num) below. If the status isn't set to START, 
qemu_guest_free_page_hint will not be called to decode the elem.

OK, will add TODO in the commit.

OK, I'll add a comment to explain that.

I thought about this more. It's not necessary to call the stop() 
function here, because we have already made the optimization thread exit 
when the guest is stopped. When the guest is woken up, it will continue 
to report, and there is no consumer of the vq (the optimization thread 
has exited). There is no functional issue here, since the driver will 
just drop the hint when the vq is full. From the optimization point of 
view, I think we can consider to replace the above sop() function with 
virtio_notify_config(vdev), which will stop the guest's unnecessary 
reporting.


Best,
Wei
