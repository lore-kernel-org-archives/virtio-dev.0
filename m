The fact that you are having to add additional code kind of implies
that maybe this doesn't fall into the pci_sriov_configure_simple case
anymore. The PF itself is defining what the VF can and can't do via
the feature flags you are testing for.

For example how is the bit of code below valid if the kernel itself
doesn't support SR-IOV:
+static void vp_transport_features(struct virtio_device *vdev, u64 features)
+{
+       struct virtio_pci_device *vp_dev = to_vp_device(vdev);
+       struct pci_dev *pci_dev = vp_dev->pci_dev;
+
+       if ((features & BIT_ULL(VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV)) &&
+                       pci_find_ext_capability(pci_dev, PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_SRIOV))
+               __virtio_set_bit(vdev, VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV);
+}
+

It really seems like we should be wrapping these functions at the very
minimum so that they don't imply you have SR-IOV support when it isn't
supported in the kernel.

Also it seems like we should be disabling the VFs if the driver is
unbound from this interface. We need to add logic to disable SR-IOV if
the driver is removed. What we don't want to do is leave VFs allocated
and then have the potential for us to unbind/rebind the driver as the
new driver may change the negotiated features.
