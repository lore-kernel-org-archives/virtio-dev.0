Actually, no, I don't think it is rubbish. See patch #3 and the cover
letter why this is the right thing to do *for special memory*, *not
ordinary DIMMs*.

And to be quite honest, I think your response is a little harsh. I don't
recall you replying to my virtio-mem-related comments.

Yes, that's what the caller are expected to decide, see patch #3.

kexec should try to be as closely as possible to a real reboot - IMHO.

I am really sorry, I can't make sense of what you are trying to say here.

Are you maybe confusing this patch series with the arm64 approach? This
is not about ordinary hotplugged DIMMs.

I'd love to get Dan's, Dave's and Michal's opinion.
