Yeah, you're right!

The commit log you quoted is talking about the benefits
of vDPA (i.e. only passthru the data path), which is not
related to vhost-user.

The usage of vhost-user you described is exactly why we
want to use vhost-user. In our case, the accelerator for
each VM is a PCI VF device and the PCI card has vswitch
logic (the VFs are the ports of switch to connect VMs).
So the card is a vswitch accelerator which will be shared
between multiple VMs. If we extend vhost-user, QEMU can
keep using the vhost-user interface to connect to the
user-space switch which has an optional accelerator.

More details can be found in the "Why extend vhost-user
for vDPA" section of the cover letter:

----- START -----

Why extend vhost-user for vDPA
==============================

We have already implemented various virtual switches (e.g. OVS-DPDK)
based on vhost-user for VMs in the Cloud. They are purely software
running on CPU cores. When we have accelerators for such NFVi applications,
it's ideal if the applications could keep using the original interface
(i.e. vhost-user netdev) with QEMU, and infrastructure is able to decide
when and how to switch between CPU and accelerators within the interface.
And the switching (i.e. switch between CPU and accelerators) can be done
flexibly and quickly inside the applications.

----- END -----

I'll try to add these infos into the commit log. Thanks!

Best regards,
