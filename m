Thanks Stefan and Michael for the sharing and discussion. I think above 
3 and 4 are debatable (e.g. whether it is simpler really depends). 1 and 
2 are implementations, I think both approaches could implement the 
device that way. We originally thought about one device and driver to 
support all types (called it transformer sometimes :-) ), that would 
look interesting from research point of view, but from real usage point 
of view, I think it would be better to have them separated, because:
- different device types have different driver logic, mixing them 
together would cause the driver to look messy. Imagine that a networking 
driver developer has to go over the block related code to debug, that 
also increases the difficulty.
- For the kernel driver (looks like some people from Huawei are 
interested in that), I think users may want to see a standard network 
device and driver. If we mix all the types together, not sure what type 
of device will it be (misc?).
Please let me know if you have a different viewpoint.

Btw, from your perspective, what would be the practical usage of 
vhost-pci-blk?


Best,
Wei
