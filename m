It might be a good idea to change the iommu instead - how about a
variant of strict in intel iommu which forces an IOTLB flush after
invalidating a writeable mapping but not a RO mapping?  Not sure what the
name would be - relaxed-ro?

This is probably easier than poking at the drivers and net core.

Keeping the RX pages mapped in the IOMMU was envisioned for XDP.
That might be a good place to start.
