My concern here was drivers that are still floating around with the
old module parameter option for enabling SR-IOV. In the unlikely event
that somebody was to use such a driver I wanted to make certain that
the drivers_autoprobe state was pre-populated.

Well the VFs wouldn't be able to do anything. Basically they would be
sitting there with no driver loaded on them unless they are assigned
to a guest, or the root user had enabled the unmanaged option. If you
did load a driver on it the VF would sit there with link down unless
either the PF driver is loaded or some user-space entity steps in to
start managing the PF.

In reality this can already happen as last I recall igb and ixgbe were
already capable of having the PF driver removed when SR-IOV was
enabled and VFs were assigned. Basically the VFs just report link down
and don't do anything. Reloading the PF driver would have it take over
in the case of igb and ixgbe since they were designed to handle that
type of scenario.

Wiping the config shouldn't have any effect on the allocated VF pci
devices. It will cause the VFs to act as though they have fallen off
of the bus though and the guests would see a surprise remove type
behavior if I am not mistaken. The MMIO and config accesses would fail
until the SR-IOV configuration is restored. Really this shouldn't be a
problem as long as the SR-IOV is enabled prior to loading the vfio-pci
driver as I would assume it would restore the state an re-enable
SR-IOV.

In the grand scheme of things how would the situation you describe be
any different than someone using the "reset" sysfs control on the PF
while using SR-IOV with driver supported SR-IOV?

I suppose if you really wanted we could add a new call that you could
put into the sriov_configure pointer that would just make it always
return error. Then that way the configuration could be locked until
the driver is unloaded.

This approach isn't without risk, but it isn't as if it is really a
new risk we are introducing, and we could do further work to help
smooth out issues like this. Much of this depends on the design of the
device and the drivers involved. What is happening in this case is
that the VFs are managed outside of the kernel itself either by some
user-space entity or by a firmware entity.

The default is the value in drivers_autoprobe. I did it that way in
order to deal with any drivers that might still be using the module
parameter to enable SR-IOV or that just don't bother with the sysfs.

That is why I only update autoprobe when either we disable SR-IOV or
we update drivers_autoprobe and num_VFs is 0.

See my note above. This is because there are callers to
pci_enable_sriov() that do so for reasons other than using the syfs
value. Specifically the legacy approach that uses the module
parameter.
