Thanks.

That is sort of what I am saying.

So for example with ixgbe there is functionality which is controlled
in the MMIO space of the PF that affects the functionality of the VFs
that are generated on the device. The PF has to rearrange the
resources such as queues and interrupts on the device before it can
enable SR-IOV, and it could alter those later to limit what the VF is
capable of doing.

The model I am dealing with via this patch set has a PF that is not
much different than the VFs other than the fact that it has some
extended configuration space bits in place for SR-IOV, ARI, ACS, and
whatever other bits are needed in order to support spawning isolated
VFs.

So this description would work for the pci-pf-stub driver. Basically
the idea here is that you have a device that is nothing more than a
function there to spawn VFs.

The other scenario that I am supporting are the ena and nvme models.
They match what I have described above where the PF is really just
another VF with some extra configuration space bits that add support
for spawning what amount to peer VFs to the already present PF.

Yes. The assumption for this function is that we are only supporting
the sysfs approach for spawning VFs.
