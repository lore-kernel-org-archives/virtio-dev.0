I don't think this can work since suddenly you need
to map full IOMMU address space into BAR.

Besides, this means implementing iotlb in both qemu and guest.

For one, the iotlb part would be out of scope then.
Instead you would have code to offset from BAR.

With enough dedication some code might be shared.  OTOH reusing virtio
gains you a ready feature negotiation and discovery protocol.

I'm not convinced which has more value, and the second proposal
has been implemented already.

I don't see where vhost-pci needs QEMU to run as root though.
