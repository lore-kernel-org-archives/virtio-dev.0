Thanks for sharing the thoughts. If I understand it correctly, the key diff=
erence is that this approach tries to relay every vhost-user msg to the gue=
st. I'm not sure about the benefits of doing this.=20
To make data plane (i.e. driver to send/receive packets) work, I think, mos=
tly, the memory info and vring info are enough. Other things like callfd, k=
ickfd don't need to be sent to the guest, they are needed by QEMU only for =
the eventfd and irqfd setup.

This looks the same as the implementation of inter-VM notification in v2:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg450005.html
which is fig. 4 here: https://github.com/wei-w-wang/vhost-pci-discussion/bl=
ob/master/vhost-pci-rfc2.0.pdf

When the vhost-pci driver kicks its tx, the host signals the irqfd of virti=
o-net's rx. I think this has already bypassed the host userspace (thanks to=
 the fast mmio implementation)

Best,
Wei
