So I was thinking about this some more. In the case of vfio-pci things
are a bit different since you are essentially taking a given device
and handing it to a VM or userspace and it doesn't guarantee a
communication between the two.

My thought is to look at making SR-IOV configuration static or treat
it as read-only when the vfio-pci driver is loaded on a given
interface. In addition I would set the TAINT_USER flag and add a
warning about loading vfio-pci on an active PF, and provide the number
of VFs that were allocated.

The idea with all of this being that we would at least have a partial
lock on all of this so that you can allocate some number of VFs, and
then start partitioning things up where you could assign the PF and
VFs as needed to the various interfaces. Once the PF is assigned to
the vfio-pci driver it would be locked in terms of the number of VFs
that are provided so there would be no need for an extra communication
channel between the PF driver and the host to deal with changes.

Thoughts?
