Yes, and user space could still take that memory and add it to the
firmware memmap if it really wants to. It knows that it is special. It
can figure out that it belongs to a dax device using /proc/iomem.

Not sure if I understand correctly, so bear with me :).

Adding or not adding stuff to /sys/firmware/memmap is not a policy
decision. If it's not part of the raw firmware-provided memmap, it has
nothing to do in /sys/firmware/memmap. That's what the documentation
from 2008 tells us.

Again, my point is that we don't create /sys/firmware/memmap entries for
dax/kmem and virtio-mem memory - because it's not part of the raw
firmware-provided memmap. I was not suggesting to add something like
"System RAM (driver managed)" there instead, maybe that part was confusing.
