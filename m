I mostly agree with this.  Some messages cannot be passed through.  QEMU
needs to process some messages so that makes it both a slave (on the
host) and a master (to the guest).

Are you saying QEMU's vhost-pci code cannot be reused by guest slaves?
If so, I agree and it was not my intention to run the same slave code in
QEMU and the guest.

When I referred to reusing the vhost-user software stack I meant
something else:

1. contrib/libvhost-user/ is a vhost-user slave library.  QEMU itself
does not use it but external programs may use it to avoid reimplementing
vhost-user and vrings.  Currently this code handles the vhost-user
protocol over UNIX domain sockets, but it's possible to add vfio
vhost-pci support.  Programs using libvhost-user would be able to take
advantage of vhost-pci easily (no big changes required).

2. DPDK and other codebases that implement custom vhost-user slaves are
also easy to update for vhost-pci since the same protocol is used.  Only
the lowest layer of vhost-user slave code needs to be touched.
