Vhost-user backend can program hardware IOMMU. Currently
vhost-user backend (or more precisely the vDPA driver in
vhost-user backend) will use the memory table (delivered
by the VHOST_USER_SET_MEM_TABLE message) to program the
IOMMU via vfio, and that's why accelerators can use the
GPA (guest physical address) in descriptors directly.

Theoretically, we can use the IOVA mapping info (delivered
by the VHOST_USER_IOTLB_MSG message) to program the IOMMU,
and accelerators will be able to use IOVA. But the problem
is that in vhost-user QEMU won't push all the IOVA mappings
to backend directly. Backend needs to ask for those info
when it meets a new IOVA. Such design and implementation
won't work well for dynamic mappings anyway and couldn't
be supported by hardware accelerators.

Yes, that's exactly what we want. After revisiting the
last paragraph in the commit message, I found it's not
really accurate. The practicability of dynamic mappings
support is a common issue for QEMU. It also exists for
vfio (hw/vfio in QEMU). If QEMU needs to trap all the
map/unmap events, the data path performance couldn't be
high. If we want to thoroughly fix this issue especially
for vfio (hw/vfio in QEMU), we need to have the offload
path Jason mentioned in QEMU. And I think accelerators
could use it too.

Best regards,
Tiwei Bie
