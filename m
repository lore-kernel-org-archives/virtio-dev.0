With asynchronous nature of interrupt injection and guest handling, 
there's no way you can guarantee it's early enough, do you?

Surely that's why I said the event is in a "performance" path that has 
to be handled as fast as possible by management.

Venu, what's your plan to add the SHPC and PCIe native hotplug support? 
People starts to get confusing. I did not see you mentioned it in the 
cover letter.
