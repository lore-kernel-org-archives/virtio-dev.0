Well, you still need to rebuild userspace since a new vhost backend is 
required which relies vhost protocol through mdev API. And I believe 
upgrading userspace package is considered to be more lightweight than 
upgrading kernel. With mdev, we're likely to repeat the story of vhost 
API, dealing with features/versions and inventing new API endless for 
new features. And you will still need to rebuild the userspace.

This is not a big issue consider It's not a generic network driver but a 
mdev driver, the only possible user is VM.

Well, I think not, kernel bugs are much more serious than userspace 
ones. And I beg the kernel driver itself won't be small.

I don't quite get. The userspace driver could be built on top of VFIO 
for sure. So kernel memory were perfectly isolated in this case.

Well userspace driver could benefit from this too. And we can even go 
further by using nested IO page tables to share IOVA address space 
between devices and a VM.
