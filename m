VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY as defined in the guest virtio_net driver supports match
by MAC address. I think we should add support for this feature bit in QEMU.
If submitting a patch to update the spec is a pre-requisite to add this
feature bit to QEMU, i can do that.

As far as i understand, group id patches to QEMU are still under review.
Matching by group ID can be another feature bit that could support matching
by group id as well as MAC.
