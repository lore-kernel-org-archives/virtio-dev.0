There is e.g. PCI Express serial number. However given that
one use of the feature is for live migration, we really
shouldn't use any ID from a real card.

So how about that. Each transport will gain a new field
which is offset within config space of a generic config.
Each field within that will be guarded by a feature bit.

E.g. add CCW_CMD_READ_CONF_OFFSET.

Is this better than a separate new generic config space?
