Assuming we have a transport agnostic high-level virtio feature to
indicate that the target type for the to-be-paired device is PCI, then
we have to use the data stored in a PC bridge to pair the device. It
does not associate transport of virtio itself with the type of target
device, right. The introduction of PCI bridge is just for storing the
group ID data for the PCI passthrough device case, while one may
define and introduce other means to retrieve the info if target device
type is not PCI e.g. a special instruction to get group ID on s390x
zPCI.

Sorry, I did not get this. A bridge is PCI specific concept indeed,
but the virtio iteself can be of other transport. Why it matters? I
guess a higher-level feature is needed to define the target transport
for the to-be-paired device. The group ID info can reside on the
transport specific area on virtio itself though. E.g. for virtio-pci,
get it on the vendor specific capability in the PCI configuration
space.
For virtio-ccw, you may come up with CCW specific way to get the group
ID data. Is this not what you had in mind?

Are we talking about the transport of the virtio itself or the target
device? Note the virtio feature must always be retrieved using
transport specific way, although the semantics of the feauture can be
transport independent/agnostic. Once a virtio driver instace gets to
the point to read feature bits from the device, the transport of that
virtio device is determined and cannot be changed later.

That is the reason why I prefer leaving it to specific transport
(zPCI) to define its own means to present and retrieve the group ID
information. The high-level feature bit just provides the indirection
to the target transport (for the to-be-paired device), while seperate
transport can have a way of its own to present/retrieve the group ID
data.

I don't know where to present that group ID data on s390 zPCI though
to be honest. But I doubt we can come up with a very general
transport-agnostic way to present the data for both (and pontentially
ALL) bus architectures.
