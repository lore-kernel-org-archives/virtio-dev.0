OK. That's the STANDBY feature sematics as I expect. Not something
like "we have a working virtio, but we need an accelerated datapath
via VFIO when the VM is not migrating". The VFIO is the what needs to
be concerned with, not the virtio. The way I view it, the STANDBY
feature, although present in the virtio device, is served as a
communication channel for the paired VFIO device, and the main purpose
of its feature negotiation process has to be around for migrating the
corresponding VFIO. While it's possible to re-use it as a side way to
achieve "accelerated datapath".

There could be other alternatives for vfio migration though, which do
not need the virtio helper, so don't need to get a STANDBY virtio for
that VFIO device.

I agree. So don't assume any device model specifics in the host/guest interface.

So how it relates to virtio or failover?
