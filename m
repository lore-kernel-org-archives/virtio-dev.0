That's true. Besides, two commands are used for msi sharing mode,

VIRTIO_MMIO_MSI_CMD_MAP_CONFIG and VIRTIO_MMIO_MSI_CMD_MAP_QUEUE.

"To set up the event and vector mapping for MSI sharing mode, driver=20
SHOULD write a valid MsiVecSel followed by=20
VIRTIO_MMIO_MSI_CMD_MAP_CONFIG/VIRTIO_MMIO_MSI_CMD_MAP_QUEUE command to=20
map the configuration change/selected queue events respectively.=C2=A0 " (S=
ee=20
spec patch 5/5)

So if driver detects the msi sharing mode, when it does setup vq, writes=20
the queue_sel (this already exists in setup vq), vector sel and then=20
MAP_QUEUE command to do the queue event mapping.

For msi non-sharing mode, no special action is needed because we make=20
the rule of per_vq_vector and fixed relationship.

Correct me if this is not that clear for spec/code comments.

Thanks!

            Userspace VMMs (e.g. Qemu microvm, Firecracker) take
            advantage of using
            <br>
            virtio over mmio devices as a lightweight machine model for
            modern
            <br>
            cloud. The standard virtio over MMIO transport layer only
            supports one
            <br>
            legacy interrupt, which is much heavier than virtio over PCI
            transport
            <br>
            layer using MSI. Legacy interrupt has long work path and
            causes specific
            <br>
            VMExits in following cases, which would considerably slow
            down the
            <br>
            performance:
            <br>
            <br>
            1) read interrupt status register
            <br>
            2) update interrupt status register
            <br>
            3) write IOAPIC EOI register
            <br>
            <br>
            We proposed to add MSI support for virtio over MMIO via new
            feature
            <br>
            bit VIRTIO_F_MMIO_MSI[1] which increases the interrupt
            performance.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the VIRTIO_F_MMIO_MSI feature bit supported, the
            virtio-mmio MSI
            <br>
            uses msi_sharing[1] to indicate the event and vector
            mapping.
            <br>
            Bit 1 is 0: device uses non-sharing and fixed vector per
            event mapping.
            <br>
            Bit 1 is 1: device uses sharing mode and dynamic mapping.

          </blockquote>
          <br>
          <br>
          I believe dynamic mapping should cover the case of fixed
          vector?
          <br>
          <br>
        </blockquote>
        Actually this bit *aims* for msi sharing or msi non-sharing.
        <br>
        <br>
        It means, when msi sharing bit is 1, device doesn't want vector
        per queue
        <br>
        <br>
        (it wants msi vector sharing as name) and doesn't want a high
        interrupt rate.
        <br>
        <br>
        So driver turns to !per_vq_vectors and has to do dynamical
        mapping.
        <br>
        <br>
        So they are opposite not superset.

      I think you need add more comments on the command.
      <br>
      <br>
      E.g if I want to map vector 0 to queue 1, how do I need to do?
      <br>
      <br>
      write(1, queue_sel);
      <br>
      write(0, vector_sel);
