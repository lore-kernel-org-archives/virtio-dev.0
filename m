Thanks a lot, I'll fix them in my next posting. Note that I recently
sent v0.10 to virtio-comment, to request inclusion into the standard [1]
but your comments still apply to v0.10.

Yes, that seems clearer and more consistent with other devices, I'll
change it. In this case "offered" is equivalent to "negotiated", because
the driver SHOULD accept the feature or else the device may refuse to
set FEATURES_OK. A valid input_range field generally indicates that the
device is incapable of creating mappings outside this range, and it's
important that the driver acknowledges it.

Fixed in v0.10

"virtio,mmio" already exists, and allows the virtio-mmio driver to pick
up any virtio device. The device type is then discovered while probing,
and doesn't need to be in the compatible string.

"virtio,pci-iommu" is something I introduced specifically for the
virtio-iommu, since it's the only virtio-pci device that requires a
device tree node - to describe the IOMMU topology earlier than the PCI
probe. If we want symmetry I'd rather replace "virtio,pci-iommu" with
"virtio,pci", but it wouldn't be used by other virtio device types. And
I have to admit I'm reluctant to change this binding now, given that it
has been reviewed (patch 2/7) and is ready to go.

I'll fix it, thanks

While the initial versions had start and length, I changed it because it
cannot express the whole 64-bit range. If the guest wants to do
unmap-all (and the input range is 64-bit), then it can send a single
UNMAP request with start=0, end=~0ULL, which wouldn't be possible with
start and length. Arguably a very rare use-case, but one I've tried to
implement at least twice with VFIO :) I'll see if I can make it more
obvious that end is inclusive, since the word doesn't appear at all in
the current draft.

Thanks,
Jean
