"stop it" - do you mean to
1) make the thread exit (i.e.make virtio_balloon_poll_free_page_hints 
exit the while loop and return NULL); or
2) keep the thread staying in the while loop but yield running (e.g. 
sleep(1) or block on a mutex)? (or please let me know if you suggested a 
different implementation about stopping the thread)

If we go with 1), then we would not be able to resume the thread.
If we go with 2), then there is no guarantee to make the thread continue 
to run immediately (there will be a scheduling delay which is not 
predictable) when the vm is woken up. If the thread cannot run 
immediately when the the VM is woken up, it will be effectively the same 
as 1).

In terms of heisenbugs, I think we can recommend developers (of this 
feature) to use methods that don't stop the VM (e.g. print).

Best,
Wei
