Yes but there's no way to implement a transitional virtio mmio
device. The version is either "legacy" or "modern".

So if you implement a modern device old guests won't work with it.

They don't particularly care IMHO.

That's a bit abstract, I don't really understand the issues involved.
ACPI is formatted by QEMU, so firmware does not need to care.
And is there even a DT for intel?

Which buses are managed by the IOMMU is separate from the bus
on which it's programming interface resides.

My point was virtio mmio isn't widely used outside of ARM.
Rather than try to make everyone use it, IMHO it's better
to start with PCI.
