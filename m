You are defining a mapping from the vhost-user protocol to a custom
virtio device interface.  Every time the vhost-user protocol (feature
bits, messages, etc) is extended it will be necessary to map this new
extension to the virtio device interface.

That's non-trivial.  Mistakes are possible when designing the mapping.
Using the vhost-user protocol as the device interface minimizes the
effort and risk of mistakes because most messages are relayed 1:1.

> 2) some messages can be directly answered by QemuSlave , and some message=
s are not useful to give to the GuestSlave (inside the VM), e.g. fds, Vhost=
UserMemoryRegion from SET_MEM_TABLE msg (the device first maps the master m=
emory and gives the offset (in terms of the bar, i.e., where does it sit in=
 the bar) of the mapped gpa to the guest. if we give the raw VhostUserMemor=
yRegion to the guest, that wouldn=E2=80=99t be usable).

I agree that QEMU has to handle some of messages, but it should still
relay all (possibly modified) messages to the guest.

The point of using the vhost-user protocol is not just to use a familiar
binary encoding, it's to match the semantics of vhost-user 100%.  That
way the vhost-user software stack can work either in host userspace or
with vhost-pci without significant changes.

Using the vhost-user protocol as the device interface doesn't seem any
harder than defining a completely new virtio device interface.  It has
the advantages that I've pointed out:

1. Simple 1:1 mapping for most that is easy to maintain as the
   vhost-user protocol grows.

2. Compatible with vhost-user so slaves can run in host userspace
   or the guest.

I don't see why it makes sense to define new device interfaces for each
device type and create a software stack that is incompatible with
vhost-user.

le, net type deals with a pair of tx and rx, and transmission is skb based =
(e.g. xmit_skb), while block type deals with a request queue. If we have on=
e driver, then the driver will include all the things together.

I don't understand this.  Why would we have to put all devices (net,
scsi, etc) into just one driver?  The device drivers sit on top of the
vhost-pci driver.

For example, imagine a libvhost-user application that handles the net
device.  The vhost-pci vfio driver would be part of libvhost-user and
the application would only emulate the net device (RX and TX queues).
