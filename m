I think you just figured out that zero pages and free pages are not 
completely the same case. So I guess this question is done :)
Please let me know if not.

The page doesn't become 0 itself when it stays on the free page list. 
Probably the above referred to this:
#1 memset(pageP, 0, PAGE_SIZE);
#2 kfree(pageP);

#1 causes the page to be tracked in the bitmap, and #2 may cause the 
page to be cleared from the bitmap. This is no different than the 
general case, a page is used, written to any value, and then freed.
Essentially, this leads to the question asked in another thread: does 
the data in free pages matter?

As far as I know, Linux treats values in free pages as garbage. People 
don't rely on values from free pages. It is similar as the case when we 
use an uninitialized variable, the compiler pops out a warning (not a 
correct behavior).

Best,
Wei
