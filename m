Sure. Code is more straightforward for this one. Let's check it in the 
new version.

I searched a little bit, and forgot where we discussed this one. But the 
conclusion is that we don't want kick happens when the mm lock is held. 
Also, polling is a good idea here to me.
There are 32 versions of kernel patch discussions scattered, interesting 
to watch, but might take too much time. Also people usually have 
different thoughts (sometimes with partial understanding) when they 
watch something (we even have many different versions of implementations 
ourselves if you check the whole 32 versions). It's not easy to get here 
with many consensus. That's why I hope our discussion could be more 
focused on the migration part, which is the last part that has not be 
fully finalized.

Yes, he's been on the loop since the beginning.

Not necessarily _need_ to share it, I meant it can be shared using qemu 
command line.
Live migration doesn't happen all the time, and that optimization 
doesn't run that long, if users want to have other BHs run in this 
iothread context, they can only create one iothread via the qemu cmd line.

I vaguely remember it's several ms (for around 7.5G free pages) long 
time ago. What would be the concern behind that number you want to know?

Best,
