Defining VhostPCIDev is an important step to making it easy to implement
other device types.  I'm interested is seeing how this would look either
in code or in a more detailed outline.

I wonder what the device-specific parts will be.  This patch series does
not implement a fully functional vhost-user-net device so I'm not sure.

The vhost-user protocol will change when people using host userspace
slaves decide to change it.  They may not know or care about vhost-pci,
so the virtio changes will be an afterthought that falls on whoever
wants to support vhost-pci.

This is why I think it makes a lot more sense to stick to the vhost-user
protocol as the vhost-pci slave interface instead of inventing a new
interface on top of it.

Plus the VIRTIO specification needs to be updated.

And if the vhost-user protocol change affects all device types then it
may be necessary to change multiple virtio devices!  This is O(1) vs
O(N).

#3 is nice to have but not critical.

In the approach I suggested it would be done by implementing vfio
vhost-pci for libvhost-user or DPDK.
