The assumption here is that the root user knows what they are doing.
We have already had some discussion on this in regards to VFIO. My
thought is we look at adding a new PCI sysfs option called
"sriov_unmanaged_autoprobe" that would be similar to
"sriov_drivers_autoprobe" and is used to determine if we allow for
auto probing of the VFs into the host kernel when SR-IOV is enabled. I
would want to default the value to false so that by default an
unmanaged PF wouldn't have its VFs assigned to the host unless we
specifically enable it by updating the sysfs value.

Basic idea is to take your generic SR-IOV enable/disable bits from
(http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/877674/) and combine it with the
some of the autoprobe bits and feedback comments from
(http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/846454/). The idea would be when
either no driver is loaded, or a driver without the sriov_configure
method we update the iov auto probe setting based on the value we set
via sriov_unamanaged_autoprobe, and then call your generic
configuration method to enable SR-IOV.
