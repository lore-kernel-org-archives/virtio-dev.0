I think we can move most of the fields from this series' VhostPCINet to 
VhostPCIDev:

struct VhostPCIDev {
VirtIODevice parent_obj;
MemoryRegion bar_region;
MemoryRegion metadata_region;
struct vhost_pci_metadata *metadata;
void *remote_mem_base[MAX_REMOTE_REGION];
uint64_t remote_mem_map_size[MAX_REMOTE_REGION];
CharBackend chr_be;
};

struct VhostPCINet {
struct VhostPCIDev vp_dev;
uint32_t host_features;
struct vpnet_config config;
size_t config_size;
uint16_t status;
}

I don't think it is different in practice. If the added protocol msg 
needs some setup on the vhost-pci device side, then we will also need to 
think about how to use it for the device setup explicitly, with the 
possibility of delivering the modified msg to the guest (like 
SET_MEM_TABLE) if using the relaying method.

Vhost-pci takes "advantage" of the vhost-user protocol for the inter-VM 
data path setup. If the added vhost-user message isn't useful for 
vhost-pci setup, I think the slave don't need to handle it even.

If this change is common to all the vhost-pci series devices, the change 
will be made to the vhost-pci layer (i.e. VhostPCIDev) only.
