1st one: I think we can factor out a common vhost-pci device layer in 
QEMU. Specific devices (net, scsi etc) emulation comes on top of it. The 
vhost-user protocol sets up VhostPCIDev only. So we will have something 
like this:

struct VhostPCINet {
     struct VhostPCIDev vp_dev;
     u8 mac[8];
     ....
}


2nd one: I think we need to view it the other way around: If there is a 
demand to change the protocol, then where is the demand from? I think 
mostly it is because there is some new features from the device/driver. 
That is, we first have already thought about how the virtio device looks 
like with the new feature, then we add the support to the protocol. I'm 
not sure how would it cause not scaling well, and how using another 
GuestSlave-to-QemuMaster changes the story (we will also need to patch 
the GuestSlave inside the VM to support the vhost-user negotiation of 
the new feature), in comparison to the standard virtio feature negotiation.


3rd one: I'm not able to solve this one, as discussed, there are too 
many differences and it's too complex. I prefer the direction of simply 
gating the vhost-user protocol and deliver to the guest what it should 
see (just what this patch series shows). You would need to solve this 
issue to show this direction is simpler :)


Best,
Wei
