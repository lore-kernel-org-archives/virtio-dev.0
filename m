So for the current qemu implementation it's 64 bytes.

Of course I understood that. There are two problems I was trying
to point out, and you ignored both.

1. The more important one I was explicit about. Sadly you ignored
that part of my mail. I will mark it as *Problem 1* down below.

2. If there is a limit to the size, then there should be a driver
normative statement ("Driver Requirements") that states this limit
MUST be respected. I didn't find this statement.

*Problem 1*

Now consider the part where the whole request is described

"""
+The controlq request is composed of two parts:
+\begin{lstlisting}
+struct virtio_crypto_op_ctrl_req {
+    struct virtio_crypto_ctrl_header header;
+
+    /* additional paramenter */
+    u8 additional_para[addl_para_len];
+};
+\end{lstlisting}
+
+The first is a general header (see above). And the second one, additional
+paramenter, contains an crypto-service-specific structure, which could be one
+of the following types:
+\begin{itemize*}
+\item struct virtio_crypto_sym_create_session_req
+\item struct virtio_crypto_hash_create_session_req
+\item struct virtio_crypto_mac_create_session_req
+\item struct virtio_crypto_aead_create_session_req
+\item virtio_crypto_destroy_session_req
+\end{itemize*}
+
+The size of the additional paramenter depends on the VIRTIO_CRYPTO_F_MUX_MODE
+feature bit:
+\item If the VIRTIO_CRYPTO_F_MUX_MODE feature bit is NOT negotiated, the
+    size of additional paramenter is fixed to 56 bytes, the data of the unused
+    part (if has) will be ingored.
+\item If the VIRTIO_CRYPTO_F_MUX_MODE feature bit is negotiated, the size of
+    additional paramenter is flexible, which is the same as the crypto-service-specific
+    structure used.
"""

There it's said that the whole request is header + additional_para and that
if VIRTIO_CRYPTO_F_MUX_MODE feature bit is NOT negotiated additional para
is 56 bytes. Let's assume the key is part of the additional parameter.
But you can't put 64 bytes into 56 bytes. So as I say above
*the key is not part of virtio_crypto_op_ctrl_req* neiter as described
in this spec nor as defined in uapi/linux/virtio_crypto.h. That means
the communication protocol description (more precisely the message format
description) in the spec is broken. QED

In my opinion this is a big issue.

I've seen that code. Thanks.

We actually don't. That is just what I've said a couple of lines before.
But we do need to know at which offset the key is (or any other piece of
information within the device readable and the device writable part).

Maybe it was not smart from me to ask this question.

I understood this specification as if it were trying to describe a message
format as structs, which are basically supposed to define the offset of the
individual fields. So for a guy trying to figure out the spec (because he
wants to implement it) asking himself at what offset a certain piece
of info is, is natural IMHO.

I don't think the placement of virtio_crypto_session_input is adequately
described. Please point me to the fragment if I've missed it. IMHO a
straightforward way to describe it would be that virtio_crypto_session_input
starts at the data address designated by the first device writable descriptor.
